                Hello my name is Amren Hossain and I am an Informatics major and Biology minor at Umass Amherst. I have an interst in cells and the human body along with a fasination for computers and technology.
                My goal for the future is to make healthcare more affordable and accessible to those in low income areas. Along with Biology, I also have an interest in nature and the outdoors. 
                I enjoy spending time with my family and friends exploring different nooks and crannies of my city.  
            </p>

            <h2>
                I also have a passion for taking pictures of the shoreline, here are some of my favorites:
            </h2>

                        This is Piers Park in East Boston, it has a nice port which also has a beach, a park, and great scenery of the Boston area. Its the perfect place to spend time with your family and have a little picnic!

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is the pond at Lynn Woods, which is about a 30 minute walk from my house. There is a trail that leads to this pond and if your ever lost you can always ask one of the hikers on the path. 
                        They are eager to help!

                        This is Marblehead Neck in Marblehead. It in a very remite part of the town so you really have to drive around a bit before you find it.

                        This is beach very close to house as well. I spent most of the summers in my childhood walking around the shoreline.
